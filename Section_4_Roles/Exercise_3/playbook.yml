# Let us also create a 3rd role called Python to install Python and its dependencies.
# A command has been run to create a new role called python and the required files are in place. Check out the folder structure.
# Now move the first task to "Install dependencies" into "roles/python/tasks/main.yml" file.
# Remove the "tasks" directive from the play and leave it empty.
# Note: We will add roles statement in a later Exercise
